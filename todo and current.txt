1. add images and character designer (there are some variables made for this) (low prio)
2. add multiple worlds (after content)
3. add content (in progress)
4. add combat (after content)
5. add settings (low prio)
6. add npc generation and interactions (after content)
7. verify function functionality
8. add race specialties
9. add character stats

CHANGES FROM OLD VERSION:

-changed variables and functions to be a little more readable by using comments
