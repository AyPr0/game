NOTES:

- working on game sytems (crafting, inventory, item types)

EXPECTED ISSUES:

1. problems with saving and loading vairables and arrays
1.5. problems with saving and loading in general
2. problems with intro content
3. broken functions

TODO (NOT ORDERED BY PRIORITY):

1. add images and character designer (there are some variables made for this) (low prio)
2. add world levels (after content)
3. add content (after world gen/saves)
4. add combat (after character gen probably)
5. add settings (low prio)
6. add npc generation and interactions (after content)
7. verify function functionality

CHANGES FROM OLD VERSION:

-changed variables and functions to be a little more readable by using comments
-content has been removed for upgrade to procedural generation style
